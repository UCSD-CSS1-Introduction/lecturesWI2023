    "In programming––*especially* for CSS––it's quite common that you'll need to **read** and **write** files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture will cover the basics of that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **why**: why would we want to read in a *file*?\n",
    "- The **what**: what is a file? Where is it stored? What is a **filepath**? \n",
    "- The **how**: how do you *read* in a file? How do you *write* a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture will focus specifically on **text files**, though there are a number of file types (`.json`, `.csv`, etc.)."

    "- Unstructured text.  \n",

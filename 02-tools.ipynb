    "**Question**: People are talking about DataHub, labs, etc. I feel a little behind because I don't know what they're referring to.  \n",
    "**Answer**: I know it can feel overwhelming, but we're going to start covering those details today. *No labs or assignments have been relased yet, so don't worry that you've missed anything.*\n",
